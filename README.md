## Wrangling of WeRateDogs Dataset

In this project, I wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) datasets that contain the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators are almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. <br>

I followed these steps to complete the data wrangling process: 

- Step 1: Gathering data
- Step 2: Assessing data
- Step 3: Cleaning data
- Step 4: Storing data <br>

After this, I performed data analysis and visualization. <br>
I also created a written report that briefly describes my wrangling efforts and another report that communicates all the insights and displays the visualizations produced from the wrangled data.
